# Karma API (Terrible name I know, will probably change)

This API is written in 100% Swift and uses the [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) web framework.  It also uses [Turnstile](https://github.com/stormpath/Turnstile) for authentication using only your phone number thanks to [Digits](https://get.digits.com).

## iOS App

There is also and iOS app that goes along with this API that will be open sourced when its ready and will show up [here](https://github.com/kdawgwilk/KarmaTracker)

## What? 

These projects will create an easy way to track tasks and rewards for a group of users.  Eg. A parent might setup a group for their family and add tasks (eg. chores) and rewards (eg. allowance or priviledges) and then can easily know what has been done and what needs to be done still.

## Why?

This project has been many things since it was began as just an idea.  It was a hobby project initially for learning what Swift would be like on the server.  After which it became part of a project for my iOS class at [Dixie State University](http://dixie.edu).  I then worked on it at a local hackathon event.  Now it has become a project which I am passionate about because it brings all my favorite things together being Swift, APIs, iOS, OSS, and parenthood.  Parenthood? Yes because being a parent is hard and raising kids is also hard and thats why I came up with the idea for this project.
